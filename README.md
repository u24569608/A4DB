### Specifics
- This applicaiton provides a GUI interface to connect to a Northwind database using MariaDB. You can perform a number of specific functions with the application based on the practical assignment specification.  

### Using the Application
To use the application, you need the following: 
- An existing Northwind database in MariaDB.
- JAVA (JDK) 24, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/za/java/technologies/downloads/), this will ensure that you do not get a "JNI" error when you execute the `.jar` file. 
  
When you run the application, please enter the address, port and name of a Northwind database (in MariaDB). Click "Connect" to connect to the database. You will need to successfully connect to a Northwind database before you can use the application fully.

When you download the application from [Releases](https://github.com/u24569608/A4DB/releases), please make sure that `mariadb-java-client-3.5.3.jar` and `mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar` are in the `lib` file, with your `.jar` file. This is so that the application can connect to a Northwind MariaDB database using Connector/J from MariaDB.
